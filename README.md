# LaTeX Homework Class

## What
This is a LaTeX document class. That means you use it with `\documentclass{homework}` at the top of the document. It provides a document layout and some helper commands that make working with questions easy.

## Installation
Certainly the easiest way to start using this template is to copy the .cls file to your computer in the same directory as your LaTeX project directory.

A better way to install this template is to fork this repository and then clone that fork to a particular folder on your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/latex-hw-template
```

Then, whenever you need to use the template, you can copy the template to wherever you need it. Also, if there are ever any updates, you can simply run

```
git pull
```

to update the template.

### Preferred Installation

The best way to install this file is to [follow the instructions here][install], keeping in mind that you're trying to install a `.cls` file instead of three `.sty` files.

## Usage

See the [homework.tex](homework.tex) file for an exhaustive list of usage examples. There are also comments explaining features for which there are no examples given.

The result is the following:

The class file also has a bunch of helper `\usepackage`s that you might want to take a look at in [homework.cls](homework.cls).

For your convenience, the file [template.tex](template.tex) is a nearly-empty
LaTeX file that contains the bare essentials to get started using the homework
class.

### `\question`

To start a question, just type `\question`. It will add the text "Question #" with a line underneath to the document. If you'd like to change "Question" to something else, use

```tex
\renewcommand{\questiontype}{Whatever You Want}
```

Similarly, if you ever need to skip numbers, you can do

```tex
\setcounter{\questionCounter}{<target number - 1>}
```

So, to skip to the 10th question, `<target number - 1>` = 9.

See [homework.tex](homework.tex) for more.

### `\question*`

Some classes like to give their homework questions fancy names. If this is the case, you can use `\question*{The Question's Name}` to make a named question.

See [homework.tex](homework.tex) for more.

### Question Parts

Another common thing on homework assignments is to have multi-part questions. To deal with these, use the form

```tex
\begin{alphaparts}
  \questionpart
    This will be part (a).
  \questionpart
    This will be part (b).
\end{alphaparts}
```
or
```tex
\begin{arabicparts}
  \questionpart
    This will be part x.1.
  \questionpart
    This will be part x.2.
\end{arabicparts}
```

See [homework.tex](homework.tex) for more.

### Induction Proofs

In math classes, induction proofs come up a lot, and they almost always have the same form: base case, induction hypothesis, and induction step.

```tex
\begin{induction}
  \basecase
    This is my fancy base case.
  \indhyp
    Assume some claim.
  \indstep
    Finish off the proof
\end{induction}
```

### Anonymous Submissions

Certain classes prefer to disassociate names from questions for a more fair
grade assessment. To have your name placed only on a separate title page,
include the `anonymous` option in the `\documentclass` line:

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,anonymous]{homework}
```

For truly anonymous submissions, make sure you remove all personally identifying
information from your preamble.

### One question per page

If you'd like each question to begin on a new page, include the `newpage`
option:

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,newpage]{homework}
```

### Spacious margins

To enhance the readability of your documents, you can add the `largemargins`
option to your documents. This fits less content on a single page, but makes it
much more comfortable for your eyes to scan across the lines.

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,largemargins]
```

This is the default in the template and the example file. Remove this option to
have your text fill more space on the page.
